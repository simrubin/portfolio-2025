# CMS Usage Guide

This guide explains how to use your Payload CMS to manage project pages for your portfolio.

## Getting Started

```

The CMS will start at `http://localhost:3000`

### 2. Access the Admin Panel

Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:3000/admin`

### 3. Create Your First Admin User

If this is your first time, you'll be prompted to create an admin account:

- Email: your-email@example.com
- Password: (choose a secure password)

## Adding a New Project

### Step 3: Add Content Sections

Projects are organized into sections. Each section has:

#### Section Title

#### Text Body (Rich Text)

- Full rich text editor with formatting options:
  - **Bold**, _Italic_, Underline

### Managing Media

## Project Display on Frontend

### Homepage (projects-section)

- Images and videos with captions
- Back button to return to homepage

## Tips & Best Practices

### Content Organization

1. **Use Clear Section Titles**: Help readers navigate your project
2. **Mix Text and Media**: Don't just dump images, explain them
3. **Tell a Story**: Overview â†’ Process â†’ Results works well
4. **Keep Sections Focused**: One idea per section

### Images

1. **Optimize Before Upload**: Use tools like TinyPNG or Squoosh
2. **Consistent Aspect Ratios**: Makes your gallery look professional
3. **High Quality**: Your portfolio should showcase your best work
4. **Alt Text**: Describe the image for accessibility

### Videos

1. **Keep Under 50MB**: Large files slow down loading
2. **Use MP4**: Best browser compatibility
3. **Include Poster Frame**: First frame should be meaningful
4. **Short Clips**: 30-60 seconds works best for demos

### Writing

1. **Be Concise**: People scan more than they read
2. **Use Formatting**: Break up text with headings and lists
3. **Highlight Impact**: What problem did you solve?
4. **Show Your Role**: What did YOU do?

## Workflow for Adding Projects from Existing Work

If you have existing projects (like the current static ones), here's how to migrate them:

1. **Prepare Assets**
   - Gather all images for each project
   - Name files descriptively (e.g., `matilda-hero.jpg`, `matilda-features.jpg`)

2. **Create Project in CMS**
   - Start with title and slug
   - Upload hero image
   - Set the date and year

3. **Add Content**
   - Write sections describing the project
   - Upload and caption all images
   - Add any videos if available

4. **Publish**
   - Review in draft mode
   - When ready, click "Publish"

5. **Preview**
   - Visit your frontend
   - Click the project to see the detail page
   - Make adjustments as needed

## Frontend Updates

Changes in the CMS appear on the frontend within 60 seconds (due to ISR - Incremental Static Regeneration):

- First visitor after 60 seconds triggers a rebuild
- Subsequent visitors see the cached version
- Fast and efficient!

## Need Help?

### Common Issues

**Project not showing on frontend:**

- Make sure it's Published (not a draft)
- Check that published date isn't in the future
- Wait 60 seconds for ISR to regenerate

**Images not displaying:**

- Verify the image uploaded successfully
- Check file format is supported
- Make sure the CMS is running if testing locally

**Rich text not rendering:**

- The frontend supports most Lexical formats
- Try simpler formatting if something looks wrong
- Check browser console for errors

## Data Management

### Backup Your Database

The CMS uses SQLite database at `apps/cms/cms.db`

To backup:

```bash
cp apps/cms/cms.db apps/cms/cms.db.backup
```

### Export Projects (via API)

You can query the API directly:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/projects
```

This returns all projects in JSON format.

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Add your first project
2. âœ… Upload some media
3. âœ… Preview on frontend
4. âœ… Deploy to Vercel (see DEPLOYMENT.md)
5. âœ… Share your portfolio!

Happy content managing! ðŸš€
